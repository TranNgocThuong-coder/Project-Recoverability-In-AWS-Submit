1. Minimum RTO for a Single AZ Outage:
    The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage in a Multi-AZ setup is typically less than 5 minutes, 
    as failover to another AZ happens automatically and quickly.

2. Minimum RTO for a Single Region Outage:
    For a single region outage, the minimum RTO can range from 10 to 30 minutes or more, 
    as it involves promoting a read replica in another region and updating DNS settings.

3. Minimum RPO for a Single AZ Outage
    The minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is zero seconds due to synchronous replication, 
    ensuring no data loss during failover.

4. Minimum RPO for a Single Region Outage
    For a single region outage, the minimum RPO can be less than 5 minutes, depending on the replication lag, 
    with asynchronous cross-region replication potentially leading to minimal data loss.
